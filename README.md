# Les P'tits Coquelicots

This is the first website I ever worked on. I initially created it in fall 2018 with Ruby on rails as training for the framework, before I decided it could fit as a plain static website. That's when I remade it, about a year later, gave it a new look even: the one which can be seen today.

I am very proud of what I've done in terms of design and accessibility. The website runs smoothly and offers a good view of all the informations that needed to be displayed.

## Features

It features the following:

 - Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
 - Testimonials carousel
 - Tabs navigation
 - Photos gallery
 - Contact form (using [formspree](https://formspree.io/))

## Assets

The website, even though is targeting parents, is supposed to remind of the world of children, hence the very soft background color and the playful primary and secondary colors, respectively bright red and green.

- background: #fcf6ea;
- red: #cf4532;
- green: #47a96f;

As for the fonts, I used [Serenity](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/serenity) for the paragraphs and [Londrina Solid](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Londrina+Solid) for the headers.

The latter is full of fun and perfectly portrays childhood world while Serenity comes in to balance it with a more serious tone while keeping it pleasant to read.

All the images displayed are the propriety of *Les P'tits Coquelicots* as no other external assets in that regard were used on the website.

## Thank you

I am very grateful for the opportunity I had to work on this project; it allowed me to grasp a first experience in terms of design and development, to see how a website works, and how - even though tidious at first - hosting a website works.
