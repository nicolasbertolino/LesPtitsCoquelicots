# Les p'tits coquelicots
[www.lesptitscoquelicots.com](https://www.lesptitscoquelicots.com/)

This is my very first website. It was initially made on Ruby on rails, as a training purpose, before I decided it could fit as plain HTML CSS JS static website.

It features the following:

 - Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
 - Side navigation bar
 - Photos gallery with a filter function
 - A contact form using formspree

 Very simple but clean display.
